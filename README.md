# TownSim
## University Thesis
In this project I planned and created a settlement builder and management 2D videogame, alongside self-made sprites and animations.

### Main features:

* **Multiple game stages** its own achievable goals.
* **Unlockable buildings** with different functionality. e.g.: camp fire, mill & bakery, farms, trading post.
* **Settler management** along various activities. e.g.: resource gathering, hunting, cooking, farming.
* **Shifting gameplay factors** e.g.: changing seasonâ€™s effects to food resources.
